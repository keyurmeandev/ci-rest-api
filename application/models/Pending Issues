My profile page
---------------
Can we put a white border around the information box at the top?
Query : Do you need it player's profile page as well 
Omar: Yes

Age field doesn't have a prompt like the other fields do
Query : Do you mean the birthdate field ?
Omar: The Age field in the profile page.

There isn't any age field

Organize a game.
---------------
Location - after choosing location, it splits name of place in half onto next line if too long
Query â€“ So how you want to display it..?
Omar: I understand the locations will be long, but splitting the words in two doesn't look good. We need to display the location somehow without splitting the words.

Keyur : so maybe I can cut some part of location and display it.


Can't invite yourself to the game - Need to be able to do this for numbers, selecting teams etc
Query - You mean I can't invite my self, right ?
        Didn't get you for numbers & selecting teams
Omar: Sorry? I don't understand your query.
Keyur : I mean we will not able to invite us, right ?
        but I am not able to get what you said below.
        "Need to be able to do this for numbers, selecting teams etc".

Select teams
------------
Brings up "my teams" page instead of bringing up a list of the 12 players who have accepted invite for game - We need to select two teams.

Query - please explain it in detail.
Omar: After you click on select teams, the next option should be to see the invited players and put them into separate teams. That isn't happening instead when you click on select teams, the my teams page appears.

Thanks
